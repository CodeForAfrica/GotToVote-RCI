		<p class="lead">GotToVote! {{ site.country }} is designed to help citizens find their nearest voter registration centre, so that they can ensure they are eligible to vote in the {{ site.election_year }} general election.</p>

		<p>This website, which is optimised for easy mobile access, explains who is eligible to register and gives an overview of the voter registration process. It also tells users what documentation to take with them to register, and helps users easily find their nearest voter registration center.</p>

		<p>This information is available elsewhere, but only as difficult-to-access PDF and MS Word or Excel documents that citizens are forced to download from a confusing variety of different ministry or other official websites.</p>

		<p>GotToVote! Ghana takes the pain out of finding the information, by bringing it all together in one place and by presenting it in a standardised format that is easily searchable and readable.</p>

		<p>Future versions of the site will introduce SMS tools, and will help users verify their registration, find their balloting stations, and track their local election results.</p>

		<p>GotToVote! {{ site.country }} is not a government website. It was instead built by local social justice watchdog <a href="http://www.odekro.org/info/odekro-overview" target="_blank"> Odekro</a> and the continental open data incubator, <a href="http://www.codeforafrica.org">Code for Africa</a> , in partnership with the new Code for Ghana hub in Accra.</p>

		<p>This project took just two days and $500 to execute. All the cleaned-up data and source materials used to power this website are available, free-of-charge, for you to reuse on your own projects.</p>

		<p>This GotToVote! {{ site.country }} collaboration is the first in a new partnership to create simple digital tools that empower Ghanaian citizens.</p>

		<h4>Where Does It Come From? GotToVote's History</h4>

		<p>GotToVote! is an example of how open data can be useful to ordinary citizens.</p>

		<p>GotToVote! was built at virtually zero cost as a <a href="http://code4kenya.org/" target="_blank">Code for Kenya</a> data journalism experiment ahead of the country's 2013 general elections. It was built in response to the fact that Kenyan citizens -- like Ghanian citizens -- were struggling to find out where to register. You can read <a href="http://ijnet.org/stories/data-journalism-boosts-voter-registration-kenya" target="_blank">a short blog post</a> about the experiment here.</p>

		<p>But, why would journalists care? GotToVote! was designed to demonstrate that data-driven tools could help media audiences act on the news they read / watch, by showing how a national event such as the elections affects people's personal lives or local communities.</p>

		<p>GotToVote! has since been replicated in Malawi (where electoral authorities adopted it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUdCVzxCt_o" target="_blank">the official government solution for voter verification</a>) and Zimbabwe. Ghana is therefore the fourth country to use GotToVote!</p>

		<p>Code for Kenya itself was also a success. It started as a pilot programme funded by the <a href="http://africanmediainitiative.org/" target="_blank">Africa Media Initiative</a> (AMI) and its <a href="http://africannewschallenge.org/" target="_blank">African News Innovation Challenge</a> (ANIC). It embedded four Data Fellows into major Kenyan newsrooms and a civil society organisation, for five months, to help kickstart experimentation with data-driven civic engagement tools. The Data Fellows were supported by an external software development team.</p>

		<p>Its success has sparked the launch of <a href="http://www.code4sa.org/" target="_blank">Code for South Africa</a>  in early 2014, and now the new Code for Ghana and Code for Nigeria initiatives.</p>

		<h4>re/USE manifesto</h4>

		<p>Code for Africa and its partners hate seeing civil society or anyone else being duped into wasting money unnecessarily on inappropriate technology or predatory consultancies.</p>

		<p>There are thousands of civic apps and other technology solutions already available for reuse, free-of-charge, on communities such as GitHub.</p>

		<p>	Code for Africa is committed to help grow these resources and the global civic technology community, by making its <a href="https://github.com/CodeForAfrica" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href="http://africaopendata.org/" target="_blank">data</a> freely available. It is also committed to helping fellow African citizen agency organisations re-purpose and customise existing civic code as cost-effectively as possible.</p>

		<p>The code for GotToVote! {{ site.country }} is available <a href="http://github.com/CodeForAfrica/GotToVote-RCI.{{ site.country }}" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p>All the data used by the {{ site.country }} project and other initiatives is available for free reuse on the <a href="http://openafrica.net/" target="_blank">openAFRICA.net</a> portal. It is already the continent's largest repository of public data, despite being volunteer run, and offers data ranging from government budget and tender information, to data about parliamentarians and other public officials.</p>
